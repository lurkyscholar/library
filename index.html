<p>Since I was ten years old, I've felt like a failed artist. This is because when I was ten, I interviewed to get into a private art school and didn't get in.
 I didn't like sitting across the table from a row of grown-ups in suits with my big portfolio in my small hands. 
 I didn't like the questions they asked (<i>did you draw this yourself, or did someone do it for you?</i>)
  I didn't like their suggestions (<i>you should draw more from life </i>). I didn'tt like the implication that I was supposed to come back and try again, do it <i>right</i> next time.
 Experiencing failure in the art world at age ten made me bitter and probably annoying. 
 It took ten more years for me to regain my footing and find myself identifying with something outside of a "creative career." 
 I'd always loved books, but I never wanted to be a writer, not really. When I was 20, I found out that I could be a librarian, and a whole world opened up to me.
  
 <p>I worked in the Special Collections at the Cleveland State library for two years (I found metadata collection excruciating when we switched to work-from-home during the pandemic. I quit after a few weeks of that.)
   I would have been content scanning pictures of trains and old city planning documents while I drank tea and listened to <i>The Secret History</i> on audiobook. 
   But library world really opened up to me in 2021 when I applied for a library residency, a regional diversity program my school was offering for the first time. 
   No one was quite sure what the library resident would do, but I knew that the role would be a good fit for me and my burgeoning interest in library careers. 
   
   <p>I had an interview with library staff over Zoom while I was still in New Mexico with my friend Li. I got the job and started in the fall of my senior year of college. 
     They let me do whatever I wanted at the library, and they tried to teach me everything (especially the things I wanted to know.) I got to choose books for the library's graphic novel collection, work on the library website and in the media center, and do "library work"--desks and shelves and call numbers and carts and books.
     I learned how much research factored into things, and that a project could be guided by best practices, which could be learned from library journals and publications. 
     I was excited to see what was being talked about in library world, in journals and conferences and magazines and reports. They were talking about robots and literacies and zines and all my favorite things.
     
 <p>I sat at my desk and checked emails all day, and learned how to manage my time and other people's expectations. I read articles when I could and wrote up Word docs of information which became important and was circulated.
   I planed events and displays. I sat on committees. The library seemed happy to have me and I was happy to be a part of its ecosystem. I learned something from everyone I worked with, and they thanked me for the work I did. 
  I designed bookmarks and flyers. I stopped feeling like a failed artist.
